            "The room key did not work i to go to lobby 4 times no parking under heavy construction noise the staff very incompetent I will not come back to this hotel\n",
            "Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location\n",
            "Bad: I was supposed to get a room with two beds and ended up with a room with one full bed for me and my husband.it was very small!.\n",
            "Bad: poor room comfort no room for clothes very old bath accesories high price.\n",
            "Bad: The pillows were very flat and uncomfortable, and there was no real blanket on the bed!. Good: Location, staff, aesthetics, price.\n",
            "Bad: Buffet food.\n",
            "Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.\n",
            "Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning\n",
            "Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas\n",
            "Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience.\n",
            "Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.\n",
            "Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.\n",
            "Bad: Nothing. Good: Location on Fremont\n",
            "Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!.\n",
            "Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price.\n",
            "Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location\n",
            "Bad: none.\n",
            "Bad: Th e food wasnt that good. Good: The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were just fair, in fact in one of them I got sick with the food.\n",
            "Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker.\n",
            "Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing\n",
            "Bad: Dirty, tiny bathroom and no pool. Good: Prime rib meal deal at Roma's\n",
            "Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep.\n",
            "Bad: safe is too small for dslr camera or laptop. not acceptable. Good: good location, good food, good price\n",
            "Bad: rooms are dated, not as clean as I like. casino is crowded - too many machines.\n",
            "Bad: Rude staff. Couldnt find our reservations waited 2 hrs to confirm eventhough prepaid..rooms not cleaned. Got smoking instead of non smoking. Will not be staying there anytime soon not. Good: Location\n",
            "Bad: The shower didnt drain. The pillows were horrible. My feet stuck to the carpet in the room. Good: Location\n",
            "Bad: Seemed old, our ac didnt work. Good: Location\n",
            "Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best.

Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.\n",
            "Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most\n",
            "Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!\n",
            "Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet.\n",
            "Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights\n",
            "Bad: Tiny grim, room with a full size bed for my husband and myself which was way too small.If you opened the window ( onto an airshaft) the food smell from the neighboring restaurant were terrible. Good: the location\n",
            "Bad: Heater didn't work, so the room was very cold. Room wifi was crazy slow, so I couldn't use it AT ALL. Staffs were lazy and rude, especially when they call. Good: Location. Center boston\n",
            "Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.\n",
            "Bad: Breakfast.\n",
            "Bad: sheets seemed unwashed and old item from previous occupant was still in closet.\n",
            "Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there\n",
            "Bad: Poor sound isolation in rooms. Good: Close to most attractions\n",
            "Bad: Small rooms for American standards. Could have been cleaner. Towels were dirty. Average standard hotel, not as good as expected. Good: Very good location, one block from the beach (2 min walk). 3 min to Ocean Drive/Lummus Park, 5 min to Nikki Beach Club. Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h).\n",
            "Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong.\n",
            "Bad: THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE SMALL SIDE...PROBLEMS CONTINUALLY WITH THE TV / CABLE RECEPTION...HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS ON MY 3RD NIGHT BECAAUSE THE AC WENT OUT...VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THAT..BUT...OH WELL...\n",
            "Bad: the only thing i found not 100 great was the low water pressure in the shower. Good: i love everything about the hotel really. it's just 2 blocks off the beaten track in a very quiet, ye central area of south beach. came during art basel so prices were of course high, but still reasonable\n",
            "Bad: Invoicing of non used items after leaving the hotel.\n",

            "Bad: Nothing. Good: Quieter compared to the strip hotels\n",
            "Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy\n",

            "Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable.\n",
            "Bad: The eatery was very expensive, not many choices, it was freezing cold in the hallways, it was noisy, the toilet leaked, and when it wasn't leaking it was running. Called for maintenance but no one came. Tub was dirty. Not impressed at all.\n",

An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)\n",

This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff. The room I was in was spacious and quiet, and had everything I needed.\n",

            "Bad: This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career. Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement.\n",
            "Bad: Check in staff was rude. Concierge never called back after leaving my information. Doors slamming in hallway could hear in my room. Double Queen Room was not a true Queen size. Have to pay for wifi. Good: Atmosphere Bedding Location\n",

My 10 year anyversary gift from my husband,a watch, was STOLEN from our room while it was being cleaned the day before we left Chicago.The head housekeeper claimd she talked to the person that cleaned our room,but said they didnt see any watch and told me I must have misplaced it, putting the robery on me!!We turned the room up side down,but of course there was NO WATCH!!Nobody offered to call the police,but we were told we could GO TO THE police station and file the paperwork.For two tourists in a country they have never been to before just a few days after the shooting that killed captain Paul Bauer, we didnt even know how to begin to talk to the police.We didnt get any compensation,but the head housekeeper offered us a drink at the bar..... finding out when we came back home that we were charged for the drink. Good: The front desk people were very helpful and nice - especially Emily Mendoza.\n",
            "Bad: One complaint. Bath tub too high. Hard to step over. Slipped while trying. Dangerous to short or old people. Not a hotel for anyone with difficulty walking or over 55. Good: Hospitality. Location. Room comfort.\n",

            "Bad: The check-in process was not good. I felt that I had been singled out as a young black male for staying at this hotel. Later, I also saw a young black male in the same situation as myself. In addition, every 45 minutes from 7:30 am - 11:45, I had housekeeping knock on the door twice, and two people walked in while my girlfriend and I were naked. Horrible experience. I called the next day to speak with the manager, left voice mails, and still no response!. Good: The majority of the staff was great.\n",

            "Bad: Can't really say. Good: How convenient the Continental breakfast area is located\n",
            "The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location.\n",
            "Bad: I couldn't understand why the fan constantly as if it never reached the desired temperature.Also that nightly service fee of 14.95 is a rip-off.\n",

            "The bath tub was rusty..literally, mildew along the edge, and small. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The Free 14.95 breakfast was terrible, couldn't drink the coffee it was so bitter and nothing hot was offered. The room ended up being 100 more than advertised after all the taxes and what was supposed to be free breakfast... Location\n",
            "Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities\n",
            "Bad: The view of the alley way buildings.\n",

            "Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not.\n",

            "Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location.

She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More\n",
            "We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager\n",
            "A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.\n",
            "It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke\n",
            "Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime.\n",
            "We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. The highway is quite close and is quite noisy. Upon entering the room it was clean and smelled good. Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in! NEVER RETURNING to this hotel, slept maybe 2 hours the whole night\n",
            "Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean\n",
            "Didn't clean our room one day for no reason, left early and came back late.\n",
            "Horrible\n",
            "We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.\n",
            "This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team\n",
            "Bad: Possibly lower parking rates,.\n",
            "Bad: Getting the wrong key to check in the key they gave us was somebody else's room, and spoiled coffee creamer not fun getting dressed to go downstairs and get a cuppa coffee.\n",
            "This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!! We even had to call the police one night!!!!Just dont go to that place ever!\n",
            "Dirty carpet, dirty bathroom flooring. One light out in the bathroom. Poor lighting in the room bathroom for applying make-up. Wall of windows should have black out curtains and shades. Walking in tot he cornstalk it smells like Pot Smoking 4 days out of the 6 we stayed.\n",
            "First thing totally rude staff!! Front desk check in took a hour! Hidden 125 fee.. i booked trip advisor all fees payed i thought. Okay now to the hotel .. Dirty! Throw up in pool so we couldnt swim.. throw up in iceroom which is a empty piss smelled closet, could go on.. i wont!\n",
            "Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS\n",
            "I am not the kind of person who would write reviews, but this time I have to, this is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life, the room smelled, was too mosit and had a lot of small flies. Overall everything is just disgusting, Worst experience ever!!!!!\n",
            "NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.\n",
            "Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!\n",
            "I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel. We paid over 500 for 2 nights so it was not exactly a budget option. The room was the worst I have ever experienced.... More\n",
            "I booked the at the Annex, bad idea from the start. Twice I went back the the desk because my key will not work. I was upgraded to the nicer side where one of the pillow case had a hole and there was a bad smell. Stayed there before and this was the worst. Don't think I will be going back there for a while.\n",
            "Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again .\n",
            "Not the best place we have stayed at in Atlantic City but it was the worse. Rooms had a moldy smell. The first night we stayed there a fight broke out in the hallway. The second night another fight broke out. Now I understand the hotel can't control that but to a certain extent I feel like the annex just... More\n",
            "Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size\n",
            "This hotel had an ant problem, was extremely loud, we found hair on our towels, and someone else was given the key to our room at midnight. NEVER AGAIN! We stayed at several Best Westerns on our vacation, this was by far the WORST.\n",
            "Let's start wth the positives. The location is good, easy to get anywhere. The price was good. The front desk was quick and professional, not super friendly, but professional. That's about it for positives. The hotel is extremely dated. The beds are tiny and uncomfortable. The room is in disrepair, broken lights, rusty doorways, loose outlets. We found a nasty... More\n",
            "We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment.\n",
            "Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,\n",
            "Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one.\n",
            "What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!\n",
            "I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area.\n",
            "I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!\n",
            "This was worst hotel. Te service no good. They need training customer service.\n",
            "Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,. Again,Please DO NOT STAY HERE\n",
            "I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.\n",
            "This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.\n",
            "The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.\n",
            "I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.\n",
            "My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once.\n",
            "I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.\n",
            "We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.\n",

Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes.\n",

The after stay phone call was trying to sell me on additional stays at other hotels. I found this incredibly frustrating. I have never had this happen with any other hotel I have booked through here.\n",

            "We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!\n",

Also only 1 bench in front for you to be able to go have a cigarette. Could never sit and relax.\n",

            "My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up.\n",

And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts.\n",

Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke.\n",

You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged.\n",

            "My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.\n",

            "I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous.\n",

Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast.\n",

            "The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.\n",

Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends.

            "We were visiting family in Portsmouth, so this location was convenient for us. The hotel is on a street off the highway and by itself, so it is a quiet location with field and woods views in the back. On our first morning, the breakfast buffet had no food left by 8:30AM, so we had to wait more than 30 minutes to get anything to eat. On our third day, when we arrived back from the beach around 3PM our key cards would not open our door. When we did get new cards, we found our room had not been cleaned and only one towel was left for all of us to shower. In spite of the glitches, we would use this hotel again.\n",

Since there is no place to eat it they don't mind you taking something back to the room which I recommend over standing there at the front desk. All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car.\n",

Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes.

The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel.

I was woken up many times throughout the night by screaming children and they were not my own!It was very loud throughout the night of people talking and running up and down the hallways! I was quite disturbed by this. Overall the room was comfortable just very loud and obnoxious people that happened to stay there which is unfortunate.\n",

            "First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.\n",
            "Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.\n",
            "No desk or desk chair. No Internet except for rooms close to office. Air conditioner very loud. Uncomfortable bed.\n",

            "Wasn't too thrilled that I had to hike up three flights of stairs to get to my room since none of the elevator were working, but then I found out from some other guests that were sitting out in the first floor hallway that the downstairs had horrible internet service, so being on an upper floor turned out to have its advantages. No complaints regarding the room, amenities, or free breakfast.\n",
            "Three fire alarms over 2 nights was unusual for this hotel. Try the mocha machine in the breakfast area.\n",
            "Checked in at 3am had an early flight, the hotel employee that checked me in was rude and very unpleasant! He lied to me about a hold on my account, before he made me go to my bank and transfor money becusee my card wouldn't work then when I came back he told me that they would place a 200 hold when he prev told me that there would be no hold!! Just rude his whole attitude! Asked for a manager but was told no one is on duty.\n",

            "We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience.\n",
            "Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!\n",
            "When we checked in and proceded up to our room, we went into the room to find they had a maintainence worker still working on something in the bathroom! They had no other rooms available, so they just hurried him up with whatever he was fixing. Tour groups of young adults, who seemed to have no supervision, were allowed to run up and down the hallways and stairs at all hours of the night! They even had ball games they were playing in the halls, and were calling other guests rooms with prank phone calls. When we called down to complain (about 11:00PM), we were told we needed to be patient! This went on every night of the trip, and we were there 8 days!\n",

The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!\n",

            "For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.\n",
            "For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult.\n",

After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found.

Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay.

After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did.

Rimane un po' fuori a Norfolk, ma e anche vicina da Virgina Beach e per cui era una ottima scelta, visto i prezzi che ci sono al mare. Consiglio questa struttura a viaggiatori o anche per lavoro senza problemi.La qualita ricevuta per il prezzo e buono.\n",
            "The hot breakfast is a good idea but horrible. Plenty of towels, but need to invest in some fabric softener. The sheets were not fresh\n",
            "The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!\n",
            "We stayed here to go to Six Flags over Georgia en route to Florida. Upon check-in around 3:10 pm I was told our room wasn't ready but they were quick to find another room. Room was clean and I had no complaints. My son wasn't happy that the outdoor pool wasn't open yet but it was too chilly to use... More\n",
            "Overall bad, bad registration process, had to make the reservation twice and in both cases no email confirmation. Almost had me booked for two rooms and would have had I not made several calls to confirm reservation. Also on the morning of check out there...MoreMany people think that a slightly poor review is a problem for a hotel...this is not true. By letting us know what went wrong during your stay, we learn what we need to work on. Thank you for letting us know and we hope that...More\n",
            "This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada.\n",
            "No Tissue box in the room or washroom. Room quality was poor. Cracks in the wall in washroom. Internet was pathetically slow, almost unusable, even late at night, very early in the morning. Would not stay here again.\n",
            "They don't tell u when u book a room but when u get there a sign is saying ur card will be charged an extra 50 a night and it will be refunded n 7-10 days...at this point its too late to cancel because they will charge u anyway...so that's y the price seems cheap but n the end ur paying more and its higher than other places..\n",
            "The ac unit was broke in the room so we were forced to open the back door and listen to the highway noise all night. Bed sheets were stained and room maintenance needed done witb broken outlets, lamp shades, etc.\n",
            "I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning.\n",
            "This is a nice location but poor maintenance and less than stellar housekeeping keeps it on the almost list.\n",
            "I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!\n",
            "Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply.\n",
            "Parking lot not cleared of snow. Paths and road very slippery with no salt applied. Front desk not helpful. No hot water for shower in morning. Other guests had same issue. Front desk said there is no hot water problem and then told it is an old boiler which has issues.\n",
            "We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.\n",
            "Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all. Exercise room has no sweat towels or sanitizer towels which we have never seen before. Room was slightly dirty upon arrival. No room service during the stay. Had to ask for extra towels and toilet... More\n",
            "The air conditioner in my room was very noisy, kept me up, had to trun it off and open windows. That let in the light and street noise (which was quieter than air condioner). Bathtub drain plug was broken so I had to tak a shower whch I don't like to do. No shampoo or conditioner.\n",
            "The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ... So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ...\n",

            "Clean, but bed was very uncomfortable. They forgot to put a shower curtin on our shower so I had to call management in the morning to get it put on. Heater didnt put out very hot heat. Bed was bad, woke up with back pain.\n",
            "The room smelled of old smoke and room freshener!!! Bare essentials for the stay... remote setting from the main building with parking unavailable nearby. Scary and totally disappointing!\n",
            "The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.\n",
            "The only complaints that I have is that the indoor pool was out of service for a day and half which wasn't good for the kids. Our balcony door stuck really, really bad! The light in the bathroom is also the fan so you can't be in there without the fan going. Hard to hear what is going on in the room with the loud noise running all the time.\n",
            "Great location, views, ammenities but hotel was not clean, older hotel, room small, elevator slow, staff not that friendly, tv didnt work till we got it fixed, AC did not work well.\n",
            "BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street.\n",
            "The room was not tidy, the customer service was horrible!!!! We could not stay the second night. Had to leave because the hotel service and cleanliness, and no hot water!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL.\n",
            "Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken.\n",
            "We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough.\n",
            "It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.\n",
            "This is a very nice property for tourists, but business travelers should look elsewhere. The internet service is very poor. So, if you have to work in your room at night and require internet access, this will not be a good choice for you. Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother.\n",
            "The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport.\n",
            "Hotel confortavel, porem com algumas instalacoes antigas. No lobby e corredores muito bem arrumado, porem ao entrar no quarto sentimos um cheiro desagradavel. Me pareceu filtro do ar condicionado sujo. O banheiro estava limpo, assim como as toalhas e lencois. Em fim, para a regiao de washington, bom custo beneficio.\n",
            "I stayed here with my family and the facility is outdated, the entrance smelled horrible. They didn't have an HDMI port for the tv, no extra comforters, the beds were a little uncomfortable\n",
            "I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The room was small and had a smell that cannot be described. The breakfast that is included is not the greatest.\n",
            "I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .\n",
            "We stayed here one night due to travel for an Eagles game. For the money,not a bad deal.\n",
            "part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty).\n",
            "The bed was broken , there was no hot water nd when I Asked for another room they said no\n",
            "very lousy front desk\n",
            "We paid for a 150.00 room but put in a room which is 75.00. I checked the rooms because my sister stayed in the 75.00 room which is exactly the same as ours. We were ripped off. The two beds in room are very small, my husband and I couldn't sleep on the same bed. One of us slept on the couch which was uncomfortable too. No more!!!\n",
            "Es un buen hotel. Ubicado muy cerca del metro y con servicio de transporte a la estacion gratis cada 30 minutos. El personal muy amable, en especial DANNY Y SAN, quienes son la salvacion de los que solo hablamos espanol. Las habitaciones muy buenas, aunque no lujosas, pero si por encima de las basicas de otros hoteles. al centro son 10 estaciones, no hay pierde pues es la ultima parada de una linea corta. aprox. 40 minutos. el desayuno bueno. En general volveria sin pensarlo y lo recomiendo. No te hacen ningun cargo extra.Si llegas despues de las 10:30 puedes tomar taxi muy facilmente, siempre hay 10 o 20 afuera y te cobran aprox. 10 dolares. A diferencia de otros hoteles un poco mas lujosos se caracterizan por ser muy amables y comprensivos. al frente hay toda clase de restaurantes, supermercados y algunos comercios\n",
            "Very tired hotel. Floors were cement hard, covered with a thin rug - no pad underneath.\n",
            "The internet was broke for one night The staff were not helpful and almost rude The toilet also borke Totally not good experience\n",
            "no hubo agua caliente ninguna de las 3 noches que nos hospedamos. Nos quejamos reiteradamente con el gerente y no brindo ninguna solucion.\n",
            "This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there.\n",
            "In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately.\n",
            "The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad\n",
            "It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared. I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE.\n",
            "Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard.\n",
            "Part of hotel was under renovation, it was also noisy. Not a good bargain.\n",
            "I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again.\n",
            "On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you.\n",
            "Hotel definitely needs updating. Worn carpet everywhere filthy evelator doors. Staff is rude not pleasant at all except nice ladies that work in the restaurant. The shuttle experience was the worst I ever experienced! Driver (the one who walks with a limp) never greeted anyone was never on time.\n",
            "The hotel was nice but the staff in the bar were lazy and rude.\n",
            "Overall experience OK. Hotel had remodel several years ago. Our room's ceiling had only been painted half way. Wallpaper in bathroom was coming lose in several spots. Tile around tub was losing caulk. Breakfast buffet was limited.\n",
            "don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for.\n",
            "I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!\n",
            "Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.\n",
            "They don't cancel a reservation even when requested a week ahead of time. Be careful when you book this inn. I had to throw my money since they didn't give me a refund. TOO BAD!!!\n",
            "Had planned a family trip well in advance. Made reservation through hotels.com. Knew hotel would be full - called the evening of reservation to let them know we were about an hour out. Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!\n",
            "They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it.\n",
            "The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast. So we had to leave the hotel to eat. Over all I was dissatisfied and would not stay at this hotel again.\n",
            "I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM\n",
            "our only complaint is that the hotel staff were not very knowledgeable about the area couldn't give us directions. Also, there is no food nearby or in the hotel.\n",
            "WE stayed at the Washington DC site and the staff was not accomidating to people who had never been in the DC area before. We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat. Beware that if they say you can walk somewhere that it will only take you 20 minutes plann for 45 to hour they have no sense of time or distance.\n",
            "What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything.\n",
            "Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk.\n",
            "This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel.\n",
            "Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room.

I was not made aware, in advance that the room was so designed. I am 6'4, so the accommodations were unusually uncomfortable for me. I was offered another room, but the hotel was unable to change my room due to it being reserved and paid via Expedia. I contacted Customer Service, and it is now 21 days, and I have yet to receive a response. I paid for 3 days, but only stayed for 2, as the accommodations were just unacceptable.

Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good.

Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first.

Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.\n",

WE WERE THERE FOR 2 NIGHTS. ON THE NEXT DAY OUR ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED THERE WAS A NOTE LEFT FROM HOUSE KEEPING STATING THAT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE BED BECAUSE WE LEFT LUGGAGE ON THE BED(THAT WAS NEW FOR ME. WE HAVE STAYED AT RESIDENCE INN AND THAT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE). THE WORSE PART WAS THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK FROM THE FUNERAL LATE THAT EVENING THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS IN THE ROOM CLEANING OR IF IT WAS AN INTRUDER.

They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful.

There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well.\n",

I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors.

            "The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating.\n",
            "We made reservations well over a month prior. However, after a long drive a two tired kids we were informed at check in that they were out of double beds. I get they made a lot of $ from a large group but we paid too! Could not care less either. Lier would be one word to describe this service\n",
            "The hotel stay was great. Stayed for a conference located at the hotel which was great as well. The only complaint I have is the parking. You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me.\n",
            "We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out...\n",
            "We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a \"sports bar\" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant.\n",
            "I booked my trip with the understanding that I would be staying at a Hyatt Regency Hotel. I did not find out until I arrived that the hotel had changed hands as of Dec 1st and under construction.We arrived Christmas day. It was a mad house, a Chinesse Christian Convenetion was in progress, not a problem. The problem was that was the convention was the main focus of the hotel staff - no Coffee kiosk, no hotel shop and limited staff. We were able to get food from the Sports bar - not a very good experience, again no staff.The construction began at 8:00 AM and ended at 3:30 Mon through Friday.So loud we were moved 6 floors.\n",
            "The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional.\n",
            "The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway.\n",
            "Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion.\n",
            "My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.\n",

When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME.

We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly.

We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever.\n",

The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!\n",

Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home.\n",

There was a small balcony outside the room but there were holes in the ceiling covering it. Also, the building was not secured at night. Anyone could walk in.

One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there.

But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER.

If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas', 'Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience.', \"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.\", \"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well.

The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent.

An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message.

The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered.

The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel.

Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location.

However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager', \"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.\", 'It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke', \"Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime.\", 'We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. The highway is quite close and is quite noisy. Upon entering the room it was clean and smelled good. Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in! NEVER RETURNING to this hotel, slept maybe 2 hours the whole night', 'Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean', \"Didn't clean our room one day for no reason, left early and came back late.\", 'Horrible', \"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.\", \"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe.

But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.\", \"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold!

There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements.

As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!', 'I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area.', \"I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!\", 'This was worst hotel. Te service no good. They need training customer service.', \"Where to begin!!!

I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.\", \"This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.\", \"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8.

The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.', \"My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once.\"]\n",
